## Limitations 
- **Authentication Persistence:** The project currently uses React Context API for managing authentication state. As a result, user sessions are not persisted, and users are logged out when the page is refreshed.
- **Future Improvement:** Session management will be implemented in the future to ensure users remain logged in across page reloads.
